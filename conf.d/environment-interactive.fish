  # TODO: Check the source code of `fish_update_completions` to check if it
  # always writes to `$HOME/.local/share/fish/generated_completions/`. Then, add
  # code here that checks the modification time of that folder if it exists or
  # the files in it or something, and re-run a background
  # `fish_update_completions` if the completion files haven't been updated in a
  # while. And probably output a notice that this is happening, and perhaps
  # disown the process. Maybe ensure that the modification time is up to date by
  # doing a `touch`.
  # Note: Checking modification time should be easy with fish's `path mtime
  # --relative`
